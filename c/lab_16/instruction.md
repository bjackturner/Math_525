Generate N random numbers (can be stored in a matrix but I don't think it has to be)

For each x (random number), perform the following...

u = x^0 + x^1 + ... + x^k

Save the time taken to run each the entire program 

Run the program with large values of n and k (make them big enough to see the benfits) for the following number of cores
-1
-2
-4
-8
-16

Compare the different times take for each number of cores
